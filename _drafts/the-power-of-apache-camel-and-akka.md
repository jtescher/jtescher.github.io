[Akka](http://akka.io/) takes a lot of pain out of trying to create highly concurrent systems. Akka's use of the 
[actor model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) provides you with lots of great building blocks with which to 
develop your applications. Also as of Akka 2.1 there is now support for 
[clustering](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/scala/cluster-usage.html) your actor system across several machines 
and building distributed applications without single points of failure.
